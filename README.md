# Financial_AI_Agent


## Project Description: AI-Driven Finance Analysis with PhiData Framework


This project leverages the PhiData framework to build intelligent AI agents for financial analysis and automated information retrieval. The core objectives are:

## Key Features

1. **Finance Agent**: This agent compares two stocks based on analyst recommendations and key company fundamentals such as revenue, earnings, debt levels, and growth potential.

2. **Multi-Agent System**: A coordinated team of AI agents (DeepSeek and QWEN) will work together to accomplish financial research tasks.

3. **Web Search Agent**: Gathers relevant stock market data and financial reports from online sources.

4. **Finance Agent**: Analyzes stock comparisons based on the retrieved data.

5. **Search Engine API** : Used Duckduckgo API for web search

6. **Team Lead Agent**: Manages coordination between the Web Search and Finance Agents, ensuring efficient task execution.


The system will utilize Deepseek and QWEN APIs for enhanced data retrieval and analysis, ensuring accurate and up-to-date financial insights. For the API's I have used free tier versions of Groq.
